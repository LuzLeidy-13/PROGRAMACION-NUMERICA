The objective of this test was to evaluate the computational efficiency of the R linear regression method ($lm()$) compared to the manually implemented gradient descent algorithm1. To achieve this, simulated datasets of different sizes were generated.

During execution, two main metrics were recorded:

-The processing time (in seconds)
-The memory usage (in megabytes)

The results obtained are visualized through comparative graphs, which show the difference between the behavior of the $lm()$ model — based on optimized matrix calculations 6— and gradient descent, which requires multiple iterations to converge.
